# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend developer currently working at **[Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy)**. I love building intuitive and seamless interfaces that not only look great, but also deliver a smooth and efficient experience under the hood.

## Working with:

- JavaScript, TypeScript
- React.js, Next.js
- Node.js, Express.js
- REST APIs, GraphQL, MongoDB
- Git, Webpack, Docker
